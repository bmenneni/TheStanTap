# Our Vinyl Collection

At The Quiet Bar, music is as important as the drinks we serve. Our carefully curated vinyl collection sets the mood for every evening, creating an atmosphere that's both nostalgic and timeless.

## The Collection

We've spent years building a collection that spans genres and decades. From classic jazz and blues to indie rock and everything in between, our records tell a story—one that changes with each spin.

### Jazz & Blues

The foundation of our collection lies in the classics. Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Billie Holiday—these are the sounds that fill our space on quiet weekday evenings. There's something about the warm crackle of vinyl that pairs perfectly with a well-made cocktail.

### Rock & Indie

As the night progresses, we shift to more energetic selections. The Rolling Stones, The Velvet Underground, and modern indie favorites create the perfect backdrop for lively conversations and late-night gatherings.

### Local Artists

We're proud to feature records from local New York artists. Supporting the local music scene is part of who we are, and you'll often hear tracks from neighborhood musicians spinning on our turntable.

## The Experience

Every record is hand-selected, and every song is chosen with intention. Our bartenders know the collection intimately and are always happy to take requests or share the story behind a particular album.

Come in, grab a drink, and let the music transport you. Whether you're a vinyl enthusiast or just appreciate good music, you'll find something to love in our collection.
