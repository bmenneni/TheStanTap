# Seasonal Menu Updates

As the seasons change, so does our menu. We believe in celebrating what's fresh, local, and in season—whether that's a new cocktail, a rotating beer, or a special wine selection.

## Spring 2025

This spring, we're excited to introduce several new additions to our menu:

### New Cocktails

**The Garden Gimlet** - A fresh take on the classic gimlet, featuring local herbs and a hint of cucumber. Light, refreshing, and perfect for spring evenings.

**Honey & Thyme Old Fashioned** - Our signature Old Fashioned gets a seasonal twist with local honey and fresh thyme. It's familiar yet surprising.

### Rotating Beers

We've partnered with three local breweries to bring you limited-edition spring releases:

- **Brooklyn Brewery Spring IPA** - Bright, citrusy, with notes of grapefruit
- **Local Hops Pilsner** - Crisp and clean, made with New York State hops
- **Seasonal Sour** - Tart and refreshing, perfect for warmer weather

### Wine Selection

Our Natural Selection program features three new additions this spring:

- **Rosé from Provence** - Light, dry, and perfect for spring
- **Sauvignon Blanc from Loire Valley** - Crisp with notes of green apple
- **Pinot Noir from Oregon** - Light-bodied and fruit-forward

## What's Next

We're always exploring new flavors and partnerships. Stay tuned for our summer menu updates, which will feature:

- Fresh fruit cocktails
- Lighter beer selections
- New wine discoveries
